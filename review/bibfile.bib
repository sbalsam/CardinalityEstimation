  abstract = {Since its invention HyperLogLog has become the standard algorithm for approximate distinct counting. Due to its space efficiency and suitability for distributed systems, it is widely used and also implemented in numerous databases. This work presents UltraLogLog, which shares the same practical properties as HyperLogLog. It is commutative, idempotent, mergeable, and has a fast guaranteed constant-time insert operation. At the same time, it requires 28\% less space to encode the same amount of distinct count information, which can be extracted using the maximum likelihood method. Alternatively, a simpler and faster estimator is proposed, which still achieves a space reduction of 24\%, but at an estimation speed comparable to that of HyperLogLog. In a non-distributed setting where martingale estimation can be used, UltraLogLog is able to reduce space by 17\%. Moreover, its smaller entropy and its 8-bit registers lead to better compaction when using standard compression algorithms. All this is verified by experimental results that are in perfect agreement with the theoretical analysis which also outlines potential for even more space-efficient data structures. A production-ready Java implementation of UltraLogLog has been released as part of the open-source Hash4j library.},

Using an auxiliary memory of m units (typically, "short bytes''), HYPERLOGLOG performs a single pass over the data and produces an estimate of the cardinality such that the relative accuracy (the standard error) is typically about \$1.04/\textbackslash sqrt\textbraceleft m\textbraceright\$. This improves on the best previously known cardinality estimator, LOGLOG, whose accuracy can be matched by consuming only 64\% of the original memory. For instance, the new algorithm makes it possible to estimate cardinalities well beyond \$10\textasciicircum 9\$ with a typical accuracy of 2\% while using a memory of only 1.5 kilobytes. The algorithm parallelizes optimally and adapts to the sliding window model.},

We have implemented our proposed algorithm for a system at Google and evaluated it empirically, comparing it to the original HyperLogLog algorithm.

  abstract = {We discuss the problem of counting distinct elements in a stream. A stream is usually considered as a sequence of elements that come one at a time. An exact solution to the problem requires memory space of the size of the stream. For many applications this solution is infeasible due to very large streams. The solution in that case, is to use a probabilistic data structure (also called sketch), from which we can estimate with high accuracy the cardinality of the stream. We present a new algorithm, ExtendedHyperLogLog (EHLL), which is based on the state-of-the-art algorithm, HyperLogLog (HLL). In order to achieve the same accuracy as HLL, EHLL uses 16\% less memory. In recent years, a martingale approach has bean developed. In the martingale setting we receive better accuracy at the price of not being able to merge sketches. EHLL also works in the martingale setting. Martingale EHLL achieves the same accuracy as Martingale HLL using 12\% less memory.},

  abstract = {Estimating the cardinality (number of distinct elements) of a large multiset is a classic problem in streaming and sketching, dating back to Flajolet and Martin's classic Probabilistic Counting (PCSA) algorithm from 1983. In this paper we study the intrinsic tradeoff between the space complexity of the sketch and its estimation error in the random oracle model. We define a new measure of efficiency for cardinality estimators called the Fisher-Shannon (Fish) number \$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft H\textbraceright/\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft I\textbraceright\$. It captures the tension between the limiting Shannon entropy (\$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft H\textbraceright\$) of the sketch and its normalized Fisher information (\$\textbackslash mathcal\textbraceleft I\textbraceright\$), which characterizes the variance of a statistically efficient, asymptotically unbiased estimator. Our results are as follows. We prove that all base-\$q\$ variants of Flajolet and Martin's PCSA sketch have Fish-number \$H\_0/I\_0 \textbackslash approx 1.98016\$ and that every base-\$q\$ variant of (Hyper)LogLog has Fish-number worse than \$H\_0/I\_0\$, but that they tend to \$H\_0/I\_0\$ in the limit as \$q\textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty\$. Here \$H\_0,I\_0\$ are precisely defined constants. We describe a sketch called Fishmonger that is based on a smoothed, entropy-compressed variant of PCSA with a different estimator function. It is proved that with high probability, Fishmonger processes a multiset of \$[U]\$ such that at all times, its space is \$O(\textbackslash log\textasciicircum 2\textbackslash log U) + (1+o(1))(H\_0/I\_0)b \textbackslash approx 1.98b\$ bits and its standard error is \$1/\textbackslash sqrt\textbraceleft b\textbraceright\$. We give circumstantial evidence that \$H\_0/I\_0\$ is the optimum Fish-number of mergeable sketches for Cardinality Estimation. We define a class of linearizable sketches and prove that no member of this class can beat \$H\_0/I\_0\$. The popular mergeable sketches are, in fact, also linearizable.},

Our simulations show that the accuracy provided by the new algorithm is as good as or better than the accuracy provided by either of HyperLogLog or HyperLogLog++.

  abstract = {Cardinality Estimation over Knowledge Graphs (KG) is crucial for query optimization, yet remains a challenging task due to the semi-structured nature and complex correlations of data in typical KGs. In this work, we propose GNCE, a novel approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to accurately predict the cardinality of conjunctive queries over KGs. GNCE first creates semantically meaningful embeddings for all entities in the KG, which are then used to learn a representation of a query using a GNN to estimate the cardinality of the query. We evaluate GNCE on several KGs in terms of q-Error and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches based on sampling, summaries, and (machine) learning in terms of estimation accuracy while also having a low execution time and few parameters. Additionally, we show that GNCE performs similarly well on real-world queries and can inductively generalize to unseen entities, making it suitable for use in dynamic query processing scenarios. Our proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve query optimization and related applications that rely on accurate cardinality estimates of conjunctive queries.},
